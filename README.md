# Naive_LinAlg

This repository is a library of naive methods and structures for performing basic linear algebra calculations.  Currently, this is just a library created as a personal exercise in Rust programming by recreating exercises for [this Coursera machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), taught by Andrew Ng.  Maybe someday I'll refine this into a tool that is fast to implement for high-level tasks.

I am always open to constructive criticism and would love to learn more effecive programming techniques.  However, please keep in mind that this is a project I started in my free time, which is often sparse.  Thank you.
